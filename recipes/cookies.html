                        <li>1 large egg</li>
                        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 cup whole rolled oats</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup raisins</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="text">the oven to 350Â°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                <li class="text">Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, sugar, whole egg, egg yolk, and vanilla, whisking vigorously.</li>
                <li class="text">Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir in the oats, raisins, and walnuts, if using, folding into a tight batter. Set the dough aside for 20 minutes while the oven preheats. (Note: if your dough seems too wet to become scoop-able, chill it in the fridge for this 20 minutes and it'll firm up). If your dough is too crumbly, stir in 2 to 3 tablespoons water.</li>
                <li class="text">Scoop into 20 tablespoon-sized balls and roll lightly in barely damp hands to make them round. Spread out onto the prepared baking sheets and bake until puffed, golden, and a touch underbaked-looking, 10 to 11 minutes. Let cool on the pans for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
